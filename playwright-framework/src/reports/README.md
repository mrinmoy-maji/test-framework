# Documentation for Reports Generated by the Playwright Framework

This directory contains the reports generated by the Playwright testing framework. The reports provide insights into the test execution results, including passed and failed tests, execution time, and any errors encountered during the testing process.

## Report Structure

- **Test Results**: Each test case will have a corresponding result indicating whether it passed or failed.
- **Screenshots**: Screenshots taken during test execution will be included in the reports to provide visual context for any failures or important checkpoints.
- **Execution Time**: The time taken for each test case to execute will be recorded to help identify performance issues.

## Interpreting the Reports

1. **Passed Tests**: Indicated by a green checkmark. These tests have successfully completed without any errors.
2. **Failed Tests**: Indicated by a red cross. These tests encountered errors, and further investigation is required.
3. **Screenshots**: Screenshots can be found in the designated folder within the report directory. They are named according to the test case and the timestamp of when they were taken.

## Additional Setup

Ensure that the Playwright framework is properly configured to generate reports. This may involve setting reporter options in the `playwright.config.ts` file. Refer to the configuration documentation for more details on how to customize report generation.

For any issues or questions regarding the reports, please refer to the main project documentation or reach out to the project maintainers.
